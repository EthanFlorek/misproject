            <p class="subtitle">Hello!, my name is Ethan Florek, welcome to my personal website! This website can be 
            used to learn more about me and my interests as well as my career goals and aspirations. I am a student
            pursuing a degree in Consumer Insight and Analytics at the University of Minnesota Duluth and a minor in Computer Science. 
            I like to use technology to solve problems and make life easier. Outside of school I enjoy snowboarding, motocyclyling, being
            outdoors, and spending time with friends and family. Feel free to explore the website to learn more about me!

                            Snowboarding is one of my greatest passions because it perfectly combines adrenaline,
                            skill, and a connection to nature. There's nothing quite like gliding down a mountain, 
                            feeling the crisp air and the rhythm of each turn as I carve through fresh snow. I love 
                            the challenge it brings — every run is an opportunity to push my limits, improve my
                            technique, and embrace a sense of flow that only comes with being completely in
                            the moment. Beyond the thrill, snowboarding gives me a deep sense of peace and 
                            freedom; it's where I clear my mind, recharge, and appreciate the beauty
                            of the outdoors. Whether I'm riding solo or with friends, it's an experience that 
                            always leaves me inspired.

                        <p class="hobby-text">
                            Motorcycling is another hobby that I'm deeply passionate about because it captures 
                            the perfect balance between adventure, focus, and freedom. I love the feeling of being
                            fully present on the road — the sound of the engine, the smooth handling through curves,
                            and the open stretch of highway ahead. Riding challenges me to stay sharp and 
                            disciplined while also offering a rare sense of calm and independence. Every ride is
                            an experience that brings both excitement and reflection, allowing me to explore new 
                            places and appreciate the journey itself. For me, motorcycling isn't just a pastime
                            — it's a lifestyle that fuels my love for exploration and the open road.
